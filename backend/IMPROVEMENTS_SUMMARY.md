# Customer Support Bot Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the chatbot to function as a professional customer support agent with domain awareness, response optimization, and intelligent escalation capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Domain-Specific Response Filtering (`domain_filter_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures bot only responds to queries relevant to the organization's domain/industry
- **Features**:
  - Detects off-topic queries (weather, recipes, entertainment, etc.)
  - Checks query relevance against organization's domain and industry
  - Politely redirects users when they ask unrelated questions
  - Configurable relevance thresholds
- **Benefits**: Bot stays focused on business-related queries and doesn't provide irrelevant information

### 2. Response Length Optimization (`response_length_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generates appropriately sized responses based on query type
- **Features**:
  - Analyzes query complexity (yes/no, simple fact, how-to, etc.)
  - Sets dynamic token limits (50-500 tokens depending on query)
  - Provides length instructions to LLM for each query type
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates verbose responses for simple questions
  - Provides adequate detail for complex queries
  - Better user experience with concise, targeted answers

### 3. Intelligent Escalation System (`escalation_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Identifies when queries should be escalated to human agents
- **Features**:
  - Detects complaints and dissatisfaction
  - Identifies billing/refund requests
  - Recognizes security and account issues
  - Flags legal/compliance matters
  - Tracks low-confidence responses
  - Determines urgency level (low/medium/high)
  - Suggests appropriate department for escalation
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures critical issues get human attention
  - Provides graceful fallback when bot lacks information
  - Improves customer satisfaction

### 4. Updated System Prompts (`prompt_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Trains bot to act as professional customer service agent
- **New Behavior**:
  - Acts as human support representative
  - Only answers domain-relevant questions
  - Redirects off-topic queries
  - Keeps responses brief and specific
  - Escalates appropriately
  - Never mentions technical implementation details
- **Benefits**: More professional, focused interactions

### 5. Organization Domain/Industry Support
- **New Fields**:
  - `domain`: Organization's business domain (e.g., "banking", "healthcare")
  - `industry`: Organization's industry sector
  - `contact_info`: Contact details for escalations
- **Usage**: Enables domain filtering and provides context for escalations

## Integration

All services are integrated into `query_service.py`:

1. **Domain Check**: First validates query relevance
2. **Query Analysis**: Understands intent and complexity
3. **Length Determination**: Sets appropriate response length
4. **Response Generation**: Creates focused, domain-specific answer
5. **Escalation Check**: Determines if human intervention needed
6. **Response Enhancement**: Adds escalation message if required

## Configuration

Organizations can now be created with domain/industry information:

```python
organization = organization_model.create(
    name="Acme Bank",
    prompt="Custom prompt...",
    domain="banking, financial services",
    industry="finance",
    contact_info={
        "email": "support@acmebank.com",
        "phone": "1-800-ACME-BANK"
    }
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Off-Topic Query
**User**: "What's the weather like today?"
**Bot**: "I'm a customer support assistant for Acme Bank, specializing in banking, financial services. I'm here to help with questions related to our services and products. How can I assist you with banking-related inquiries?"

### Example 2: Simple Question (Brief Response)
**User**: "What are your hours?"
**Bot**: "Our branches are open Monday-Friday 9am-5pm, and Saturday 9am-1pm. Online banking is available 24/7."

### Example 3: Complex Issue (Escalation)
**User**: "I was charged twice for the same transaction and need a refund immediately!"
**Bot**: "I understand this is frustrating. Let me connect you with Billing Department for specialized assistance. This matter requires immediate attention from a specialist who can provide you with the detailed assistance you need.

You can reach us at: support@acmebank.com
Phone: 1-800-ACME-BANK"

### Example 4: Low Confidence (Escalation)
**User**: "What's the status of my loan application from last week?"
**Bot**: "I don't have access to specific account information for your loan application. Let me connect you with Customer Support for specialized assistance. A specialist from our team will be better equipped to help you with this specific request.

You can reach us at: support@acmebank.com"

## Technical Details

- **Domain Filtering**: Checks relevance with configurable confidence thresholds
- **Response Length**: Token limits range from 50 (yes/no) to 500 (comprehensive)
- **Escalation Triggers**: Multiple detection patterns for various issue types
- **Prompt Engineering**: Customer service-focused system prompts
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing organizations work without domain/industry fields

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with off-topic queries to verify redirection
2. Test simple vs complex questions to verify length optimization
3. Test complaint scenarios to verify escalation
4. Test with and without domain/industry configured
5. Verify responses stay within appropriate token limits
6. Test follow-up questions to ensure context is maintained

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
1. Admin UI for configuring domain/industry during organization creation
2. Analytics dashboard showing escalation rates and reasons
3. Custom escalation rules per organization
4. Multi-language support for escalation messages
5. Integration with ticketing systems for escalated queries
